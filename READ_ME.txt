Included is the bot that ran the @CrushesBGFast account. Unfortunatly, due to spam and harassment, it had to be shutdown. The main errors being that the bot couldn't understand context, 
i.e. "I'm so fat from all that mac & cheese I just ate" <--- Acceptable
i.e. "(blank) is so fat" <-- Unacceptable

Until I learn how to make the bot understand context, a human has to go in and manually delete malicious comments. Therefore, I shut it down
